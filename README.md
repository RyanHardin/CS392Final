# CS392Final

FinalProjectOverview:
Your final project for the class revolves around the creation of a mobile application using Cordova, React Native or Native SDKs. In addition to creating the mobile application, you will be required to prepare a short write up documenting the design of your application, lessons learned, future work, etc. Finally, you will be required to give a brief presentation to the class on the application you built. The complete final project is due April 20th via Canvas (including all three components). Presentations will be given on April17thand19th.CS392 students have the option of working in teams of two for the final project with some additional requirements.

The type of application you build is largely up to you, however, all project ideas should be run by the instructor for approval/feedback. While ambition is certainly encouraged, it's better to have a small polished application than a large broken application.You application should meet the following general criteria:-Contains at least 3 functional Views/Pages-Utilizes a model or dynamic data source, such as a web API, or data persisted to the local device-Utilizes at least 3 Cordova plugins (or native functionalities, if doing RN/Native development)-Includes an icon and splash screen-Utilizes a style framework for a responsive look and feel-Compiles and deploys to a target mobile platform (Android or iOS)
